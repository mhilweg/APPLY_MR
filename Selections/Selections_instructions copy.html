       The four participants performed in two rounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <i>round 1</i>, they had 2 minutes to find as many
        matches as possible among sets of mixed difficulty. They were each randomly allocated a mix
        of either mostly easy or mostly hard pairs.
        In this round, participants had to find matching pairs in sets which are drawn from one of two mixes

      <ol>
          <strong>Mix 1:</strong> 6 easy and 2 hard matching pairs.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <strong>Mix 2:</strong> 2 easy and 6 hard matching pairs.
        </ol>
