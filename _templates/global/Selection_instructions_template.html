        <h4>Participants Rounds</h4>
       The four participants performed in two rounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <i>round 1</i>, they had 2 minutes to find as many
        matches as possible among sets of mixed difficulty. They were each randomly allocated a mix
        of either mostly easy or mostly hard pairs.
        In this round, participants had to find matching pairs in sets which are drawn from one of two mixes

      <ol>
          <strong>Mix 1:</strong> 6 easy and 2 hard matching pairs.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <strong>Mix 2:</strong> 2 easy and 6 hard matching pairs.
        </ol>

          You will see <strong>each participant's round 1 score</strong>. However, you will not know which mix they received

        <p>
          Your task is to select one participant from each group. You will earn <strong>£1 if your selected participant </strong>

      You will see the final score each of the four participants achieved in round 1. However, you will not the mix of sets that they faced in that round
      (in other words, the score could have been achieved through sets with mostly easy pairs or mostly hard pairs).
      Your task is to select one of these participants.
      You will then earn £1 if you selected the best performer (i.e. the worker with the highest score) in round 2, where workers faced sets containing only hard pairs.
