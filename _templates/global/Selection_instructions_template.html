        <h4>Participants Rounds</h4>
       The four participants performed in two rounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <i>round 1</i>, they had 2 minutes to find as many
        matches as possible among sets of mixed difficulty. They were each randomly allocated a mix
        of either mostly easy or mostly hard pairs.
        In this round, participants had to find matching pairs in sets which are drawn from one of two mixes

      <ol>
          <strong>Mix 1:</strong> 6 easy and 2 hard matching pairs.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <strong>Mix 2:</strong> 2 easy and 6 hard matching pairs.
        </ol>

          You will see <strong>each worker's round 1 score</strong>. However, you will <b>not know</b> which mix they were allocated to

          Your task is to select <b>one worker</b> from each group. You will earn <strong>£1 if your selected worker </strong>
          achieves the highest score in <b>round 2</b> among others in the group, when all workers face only hard pairs.
          If several workers tie for the highest score, you are paid if you selected one of the tied workers.

          You will make selections for <b>five different groups</b>. At the end of the study, <strong>one of your five choices</strong>

      You will see the final score each of the four participants achieved in round 1. However, you will not the mix of sets that they faced in that round
      (in other words, the score could have been achieved through sets with mostly easy pairs or mostly hard pairs).
      Your task is to select one of these participants.
      You will then earn £1 if you selected the best performer (i.e. the worker with the highest score) in round 2, where workers faced sets containing only hard pairs.

      You will make the selection for five different groups of participants. For each group you will be asked to select one participant.
