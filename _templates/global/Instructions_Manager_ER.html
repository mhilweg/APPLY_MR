        For this study, you will act in the role of a <strong>Manager</strong>.<br><br>
        Your job is to select one worker from a group of four who competed on a task.
        You will find out more about the task shortly.
        The worker you select will then perform another round of the task and your payment will depend on that workers'

        <strong>Background</strong> <br>
        A few days ago, four Prolific participants (herein referred to as workers) participated in a competition.
        They individually completed an <strong>emotion-recognition memory task</strong> for 2 minutes.
        Their performance in this task was influenced by their <strong>emotion recognition skills</strong>.

        <br><br>
        In the next page, we will provide you with the instructions for the task and then you will have a chance to practise the task.
        While you practise, you can familiarize a bit on the task, but your performance will not be part of your final payment.
      <br><br>
        <strong>Your final payment</strong> will depend on your <em>selection choice</em>. You will receive more information about it after the practise round.
