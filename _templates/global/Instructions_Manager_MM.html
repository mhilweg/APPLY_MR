        <strong>Background</strong> <br>
        A few days ago, four Prolific participants (workers hereafter) participated in a competition.
        They individually completed a <strong>maths-memory task</strong> for 2 minutes.
        Their performance in this task was influenced by their <strong>maths skills</strong>.

        <br><br>
        You will be given the chance to practice on this task.
        In the next page you will find the instructions and then you will proceed with a practise round.
        In this round you can familiarize a bit on the task, but your performance will not be part of your final payment.
        <strong>Your final payment</strong> will depend on your selection choice. You will receive more information about it after the practise round.
