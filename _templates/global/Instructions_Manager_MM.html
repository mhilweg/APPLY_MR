      <strong>Background</strong>
      <br>
      <p>
        A few days ago, four Prolific participants took part in a competition. Each of them individually completed a
        <strong>maths-memory task</strong> for 2 minutes. Their performance in this task depended on their
        <strong>maths skills</strong>. You will learn more about this task shortly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The competition is such that another Prolific participant—referred to as the <strong>Manager</strong>—
        would then select one of them as the winner of the competition, affecting their payment.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this study, <strong>you will take the role of the Manager</strong>. Your job is to select one participant from the group
        of four. <strong>Your bonus payment will depend on that participant’s performance</strong> in a final subsequent round.
      </p>

      <br>

      <strong>Procedures</strong>
      <br>
      <p>
        You will first have the opportunity to <strong>practice the task</strong> yourself. On the next page, you will find
        the task instructions and then complete a short practice round.
      </p>

      <p>
        The purpose of this practice round is to help you understand the task.
        <strong>Your performance in the practice round will not affect your payment.</strong>
        Your final payment will depend solely on the <strong>participant you choose</strong> and that participant’s performance in the final round.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the practice round, you will receive more information about how to make your selection and how your bonus payment is determined.
      </p>
