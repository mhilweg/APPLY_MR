       Please read the general instructions below carefully.
       After reading, you will be asked to answer a few questions to check your understanding.
       <br><br>

        For this study, you will act in the role of a <strong>Manager</strong>.
       Your job is to select one worker from a group of four who competed on a task.
        You will find out more about the task shortly.
        The worker you select will then perform a task and your payment will depend on that workers' performance
        in the task.

        <strong>Background</strong>
        <br>
        A few days ago, four Prolific participants participated in a competition.
        They individually completed <strong>maths-memory</strong> for 2 minutes.
        Their performance in this task was influenced by their <strong>maths skills</strong>.

        <br><br>
        You will be given the chance to practice on the task.
        In the next page you will find the instructions and then you will proceed with a practise round.
        In this round you can familiarize a bit on the task, but your performance will not be part of your final payment.
        Your final payment will depend on your selection choice. You will receive more information about it after the practise round.
